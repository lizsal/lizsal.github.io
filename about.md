Aloha from Big Island! I live in Kona, Hawaii with my husband, two sons, and their Gramma Brown. We moved here in 2018, and we spend a good amount of time at the beach or looking out at the ocean. I love all sorts of things that I'm no expert in but find enjoyment from doing. I'm not a fan of cooking, and I only eat chocolate if there are enough other flavors to overpower it. I've spent significant parts of my life in various parts of NY—upstate and down—and Salt Lake City.

Another change in 2018 was my joining GitHub. I'm a Director of Engineering with a consulting background. I like working on databases more than user interfaces, and I love to lead teams to plan and prioritize work to delight our users and customers, delivering value quickly and expanding on it over time. Over my career, I keep navigating towards work that enables engineers to really have fun at work while they're maximizing how effective they are. You can typically find me focusing in software developer life cycle related (SDLC) areas like CICD, internal tooling, and automation.

### Human User Guide (HUG)
#### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I'm a wee bit competitive
* I used to be my biggest critic, and now I'm my biggest fan
* I consciously fight the urge to exaggerate things to myself or others in order to justify my feelings
* I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and worry that some will judge me to be less than the fiercely inclusive and loving and wonderful person that I am because of what they think about that
* I'm 6'1", red/blue on the TotalSDI spectrum, my love language is quality time, and my superpower is Motivator.
#### What drives you nuts?
* Feeling ghosted
* Lack of transparency or cooperation
* Rehashing out the same decisions again and again
* It doesn't bother me when people don't know, but it really does when they don't try or don't care
* Many complaints and little action. Many judgements and little seeking understanding.
#### What are your quirks?
* I love to be goofy, and think I am funny (not sure how may others share that view)
* Even if I try to cheat or bluff, I'm a dead giveaway. No poker face here.
* I don't like chocolate or coffee, but I love peanut butter and caffeine - Mio drops ftw
* I like proper spelling and grammar - not that I judge when it isn't there, but I love when people make it better and get it right
#### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* I do care. Probably too much.
* I'm passionate, but not heartless.
* I don't care about the how as much as I do the what, but I'll step in with the how when we aren't getting to the what. It doesn't mean I'm stuck to those ways.
#### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* I love when people want to pair, brainstorm, and try new things out with me
* It's great when people clarify how much they care about something, so that I can properly give attention to a big deal or not worry about a smaller one as much
* Raising concerns early
#### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* Put too much weight into roles/titles and set unrealistic expectations because of them
* Gossip and shut others down
* Not trust or invest in others
#### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* Check in on me and on others, see if they can help with anything - build each other up
* Stay focused on the priorities, and queue up the distractions appropriately
* If I'm getting amped up or working too much, remind me to take a break and focus on what's really important
#### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* Listen - and ask if they need to talk it out, if they need help, or if they need an intervention
* Celebrate successes, hone what they're good at
* See what they're interested in and working on, see if they want me to hold them accountable
* Figure out if they're comfortable, and if they are, figure out something hard to do and dig in
#### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* Slack anytime, and definitely use threads in channels more
* I love to zoom about anything and nothing
* Fly to Hawaii and meet me for shave ice
#### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* Ask nicely
* Tell me how it will help us or others be more efficient, make money/cut costs, attract customers, or what we'll learn from it
#### How do you like to give feedback?
* As quickly and simply as possible, straight up with no drama and lots of respect.
* I'll give you an observable fact without judgement, tell you the impact I think it could have, and ask for clarifications and/or make a request and/or thank you.
#### How do you like to get feedback?
* As quickly and simply as possible, straight up with no drama and lots of respect.
