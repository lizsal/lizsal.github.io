title: Calendaring Experimenting
---
Calendars suck. Oh my goodness it is much easier to let the meetings come in as they may and do just-in-time shuffling than to try to wrestle and wrangle them.

But that doesn't get me what I want to achieve anytime soon, so I have been doing experiments to get more intentional with how I spend my time. It's hard, but worth it.

While I do have separate calendars for work and home, I no longer treat my life as two separate entities competing for the same space. I'm talking about the space *around* the standard work day times specifically, where work would often bleed into personal time.

Here's what I'm trying:  
- Be intentional with how I spend all of my time
- Say yes, later (and when), or no to every request for my time from myself or something else

### What My Current Calendar Experiment Looks Like

#### One-time Setup
- Earlier this year, I invested [1] in coming up with a list of the general things that are most important to me to develop and maintain: connecting with others, staying healthy, and having a bigger purpose. Having vision statements about these and other areas of life give me something to refer to often to make prioritization decisions. I call this **My Map**, and it's essential. Going through the priorities on My Map one by one, I figured our what strategies to try to get closer to them. Also, I have a recurring scheduled event to spend time revisiting these periodically and keep them current.
- I gutted my calendar. Not really. I very much wanted to, but found it easier to start with a new calendar and copy over the things that I knew I'd need to keep and were already scheduled. Like the previously mentioned recurring event, and a lot of work meetings. Basic essentials things like sleep, eat, and sports practice went on, too. [2] 
- NEW: I tracked how I spend my time by category for a week or two on a fresh calendar. Based on that, I created a daily target schedule. Here's the breakdown I'm going to aim for each day to avoid overcommitting myself and squeezing into my valuable non-work time: 4 hours of sync meetings, 2 hours of async work, 2 hours of disconnected work, 1 hour break. ðŸ¤ž
	
### Weekly Steps [3]
- Considering all the inputs (My Map and related strategies, existing calendars, To Do lists), only review My Map, and hide the rest for now. I mean it. No peaking.
- With those priorities in mind, think deep for a couple minutes. "What do I want completed by the end of this week?" Note that these should be specific actions and real results--observable trials and/or measurable value out of something I created that didn't exist before.
    â—‹ Write it down. 
    â—‹ *Break it down right now into all the detail*. That will help figure out how much time it will take, and give an easy plan to execute when its time comes up. Keep things in 2 hour or less chunks to make it easy to schedule into focus time blocks (keep reading, those come up soon enough).
- Brain dump anything else on my mind that I need to get done. Again, no peaking at my other lists yet, go with the top of mind.
- Break each thing down into specific plans, or decide to `postpone it`, `assign it`, or `don't do it`. Capture follow up items for things I've assigned out, and put a target date on things I've postponed. Otherwise they're things I won't do. Tip: Daily, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly routines and matching recurring calendar events are super helpful. [4]
- NOW bring up my other inputs and see if I'd like to adjust anything on my clean list.
- Do another pass and see what I can combine or string together! My fave combo: beach and workout and family time, with a bit of planning time if my partner drives, and a quick trip to the store on the way home. 
- Put the list in priority order. 
- Now, back on my calendar. I'm not slotting anything in yet. First, create blocks of times by every major category, like sleep, meetings, free time, interruptions, exercise, meals. Yes, Liz, take breaks[5] and eat. And most importantly, schedule slots to disconnect and be present and *focus*. When it comes to my priorities, this is the time to do that work.
- And here's the fun part: go through that list in order, and put it all on my calendar into those blocks. When I'm out of available time slots, the rest of the `doing this week` list moves into one of those other three categories. 
- That's all the hard work! Now, go through the week and just follow the plan. It's all as good as done. When things come up, move things around as needed if I choose to do them, or I can choose to postpone, assign, or skip.
- At the end of the week, do a retro (what worked well, what kept it from working well, what do I want to try next). Celebrate what I did accomplish, note tweaks to make for next time, and capture anything not done under postponed. Schedule that, too.

#### Timing
Well. This has seriously been a series of experiments and activity consuming quite a bit of time this entire year, and I'm not done yet. So there's that, but I am not about to let it deter me. I've heard people can do it in an hour once they get into the habit of it and there's a lot of rinse and repeat. I'm not there yet. It still takes me a couple hours, so my next tweak is to do an hour on Sunday night (focused on me) and an hour on Monday morning (focused on work).

#### What I've Learned So Far
- I don't say yes to things right away as much as I used to, and respond with when I think I will get to it. What I see is that people come to expect this from me and will ask me less or wait. This is a good thing.
- I still schedule more things to do than humanly possible, and don't get some of it done.
- My self-confidence increases as I come to realize I'll accomplish whatever I set out to do. I'm getting better about being in charge of my time and setting expectations.
- While on the surface it can be hard, in my reality it can be easy if I stick to key decisions I've made about my priorities, and rinse and repeat more.
- It really takes me a lot longer to do things than the time I schedule for them, usually because I don't account for context switching, interruptions, and fatigue.
- I am a lot more reactionary than I realized, and usually dig in to address something that just came up more than sticking to plan and scheduling the new thing for later. It's something I want to unpack to see if I should schedule time for this specifically, or if I want to dig in about how I value what I have already scheduled and if I'm avoiding it for reasons.

I'm absolutely convinced that this is more effective for me, so I'm keeping at it, and it is getting a little easier each time.

In fact, I'm going to stop writing about this (which I didn't schedule) and sit and do another attempt right now.

#### Distracting Extras
[1] Thank you, [Kate Byers and Corporate Women Unleashed](https://kathleenbyars.com/program/) and Jadine Cleary for helping me come up with My Map! Sundance forever! (Inside joke I'll explain to anyone interested, and related -- if anyone knows a good graphic designer looking for small kine freelance work, hit me up)  
[2] This is really easy to do with Google calendars, acknowledging their [data privacy policies](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/10366125?hl=en).  
[3] Inspired by [Monday Hour One](https://mondayhourone.com/). That program is **good**, but I haven't invested the time to fully digest and implement it yet.  
[4] I use [mindmeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/) on my laptop or tablet for this right now, though I've tried text files, Trello, GitHub personal project boards, Google tasks, and probably a dozen more I'm forgetting. The only drawback with mindmeister is it's a little challenging to use on mobile -- not prohibitively so for general reference and tweaking, but I'm definitely not doing this process with it on my phone.  
[5] Fun fact: I play [Wordscapes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordscapes/id1207472156), and noticed how often I can solve a word that I couldn't previously figure out after I step away from the level for about an hour and come back fresh! I never believed in the power of a break before that discovery, despite all the evidence I've heard to support it. I'm a stubborn learner sometimes. So unusual for all of us I'm sure.
