title: Say It in Three Sentences
---

I use this tip a lot myself, and share it often. When you really need to get a point across and make sure it lands, give yourself a three-sentence cap. And here's a formula to go with it that is often useful for things like proposals, feedback, pushback, risk acknowledgments, and summaries: 
1. Fact
2. Impact
3. Question/Request/Comment

A really useful skill for communicating clearly is being able to separate facts from your interpretation of them. Lead with clear facts first that could be proven undeniably. Data, quotes, accurate descriptions.

Next--note here that we completely skip our own judgement and subjective assessment--talk about the impact. And tailor the focus of that impact to your audience. If they likely won't care about it, consider their perspective and see if there's something that will resonate with them more.

Lastly, wrap it up. Do you have a specific action you want them to take? Do you need them to confirm or clarify something? Do you want to take this opportunity to convey your commitment or forward focus?

These three questions can also help with styling, especially when it is important:
- Will this stop the conversation or invite more discussion?
- Are you going to strain or build relationships?
- Is it focused on the past/present or bringing us forward together towards what we want?

While we're talking about threes - am I the only one who feels compelled to make a sentence that justifies or explains something have three things in it? So many times I find myself writing this, that, and .... then I sit and struggle to come up with a third in order to have that glorious [oxford comma](https://www.lexico.com/explore/what-is-the-oxford-comma). I recently noticed that and have let it go, and I find that a list of just two things is absolutely beautiful. So say it in three sentences with one or two parts in them. ðŸ˜„
