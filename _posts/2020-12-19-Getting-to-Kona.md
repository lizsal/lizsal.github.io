title: Get to Kona, Hawaii with a quarantine exemption
---

:warning: My experience is no indicator  of or predictor of success for of anyone else’s :smiley:

Right now, there is a [mandatory 14-day quarantine for any travellers arriving in Hawaii](https://www.gohawaii.com/travel-requirements). Big Island is one of the islands offering an exemption if you provide proof of an approved negative COVID test result. [This link](https://www.gohawaii.com/travel-requirements) provides full details, but what I outline below may also help you...
- If you are having trouble finding a location or available appointment with one of the approved COVID test providers
- If you are worried about the nose stick type of test, and you are able to generate a lot of saliva
- If you are not flying on Tuesday or Wednesday, and if you have six or more days before your flight to Hawaii to go through all this
- If you are comfortable with doing the test from the comfort of your desired location and able to connect with the testing provider over Zoom

Vault Health is an approved Hawaii COVID test provider, and was WONDERFUL to work with.

I was flying to Kona on a Saturday, and I started the process on Sunday night.

1. **Figure out the day and time you need to take the test after.** According to Hawaii’s rules, you need to take the test within 72 hours of your flight that will land in Hawaii (not any connecting flight). So the clock starts 3 days before that scheduled departure time. However, the report does not indicate the time, only the date, so it could be that time is actually irrelevant, only the day. Note that you will be taking the test over a zoom call, and the available hours for that are M-F 8a-8p Eastern Time. Make sure you can take the test and ship it THREE DAYS BEFORE your flight. So if your flight is on Saturday, you want to take it and ship it on Wednesday. This is why Tuesday and Wednesday flights don’t work, because you’d have to take your test on the weekend and that isn’t an option.
1. **Figure out where you are going to ship your test kits from, and when.** Look on the app or website to identify the UPS shipping locations you’ll use, and note there what the last drop off time is to make the Next Day Air cutoff for that day (it’s listed with each location). Ideally you will take the test, and then take it right to that UPS location so that it can be shipped out and arrive at the lab the next morning - the return label is for Next Day Air, not Saver, so it gets to the lab early. That was comforting to me. 
1. **Go to Vault Health website, and order a kit for each traveler** over 5 years old. Note that at $119 their test is $20 to $30 cheaper than many other providers, and includes all shipping costs. Each traveler will need their own vault health login. Note that there are no refunds, so before you order, make sure you can generate enough spit to fill the larger-than-you-think-it-is vial they’ll send you (young kids may have a difficult time with this), and that it is two days before you have to take your test so they will arrive in time (three days if it is after 3P ET since they’ll need another day to arrive).  You technically could order them the day before you have to take the test, but there’s risk they won’t arrive before you have to ship them. You certainly can order them way in advance, too.
1. **Don’t open the kits when they arrive**; wait for your zoom call. The kits will be shipped via UPS Next Day Air Saver, so they will show up by the end of the next day if you were able to order before 3p eastern US time, of the end of the following day otherwise. Note that they are individually shipped, and may not arrive together. I had one arrive in the morning, and two in the afternoon. This is the reason that I wouldn’t count on taking the tests the day the kits arrive, because you may miss the next day air cutoff time if they don’t show up in time. Be sure not to take them as soon as they arrive if it is not within 72 hours of that departure. Pro tip: sign up for UPS shipping notifications in the UPS app or website so that you can see when they’ll be coming.
1. **Get ready to take the tests at least one hour before you need to take them to UPS**. Open each box to remove its contents, but do not open any of the packages within the box. Throw the outer box sleeve away. Get a marker and write on the front and back in large letters on the box, on the ups return envelope, and on the silver test vial envelope: STAT HAWAII. Log into Vault Health for each traveler with a device that has a camera attached to it, which you will use to scan the vial and return bag code. Fill in the required information and submit it for each user. On one user, also click through to initiate the zoom call. Wait times are typically between 10-20 minutes, and you’ll also be on the call around 10-20 minutes with them if you have 3 travelers like I did. You can all take your tests together.
1. **Ship your tests!**
1. **Get your results.** They will email you when your tests arrive at the lab, and again when they complete the tests. We received our results within 24 hours of shipping them! Well ahead of the deadline, and the promised 48-72 hour turnaround.
1. **the Get your information to the Hawaii Safe Travel site before you fly.** You need to register with Safe Travels Hawaii website. One per family, and then you’ll put your trip details in. Once you have your test results, you can download the Hawaii Standard Result Form from Vault Health, and then upload it to the Hawaii Safe Travel site for each traveler. If you do not upload your pdf files before you fly, you will not get a quarantine exception, and there are ZERO exceptions to this rule. The day before, you also need to login again and take a health survey - this isn’t available until 24 hours before you depart on your Hawaii flight.
1. **Print out your PDFs and QR code, so you have a backup when you need to show them.** Look in your email for the QR code once you’ve uploaded your results to Hawaii’s site. You can request them send it again if you lose that email. You will need those PDFs and the QR code, so as a backup print them out and bring them with you
1. **When you get to the gate, check in with the gate attendants** who will scan your QR code, review everyone’s test results, and then provide you with wristbands to clear you through arrival checks. Get on the plane now and have a great flight!
1. **Arrive in Hawaii!** Show your wristband to the arrival crew and you are cleared to go. I've heard that there is random testing happening at the airport, but I did not experience this or witness it.

One final thought - you were tested three days ago. Keep in mind that you still may have been exposed since then, so please act responsibly! Wear your mask, wash your hands, and avoid going out, especially where you'll be in close proximity with others. Consider being tested again after you've arrived. A surge on COVID cases could be devastating for a remote island with limited healthcare options.
